			<p class="text-center ">I aimed to give the whole page an air of sophistication, modernity, and elegance. I was inspired by
the elle.nl website. The fashion and lifestyle magazine Elle is well-known online. The page should feel
feminine and powerful. Two phrases that complement each other perfectly, in my opinion. While
keeping these words in mind, I made the decision to use pink, black, and white as the primary colors
for my website. Pink to keep it feminine, black to keep it powerful.
I chose the fonts because I thought they complemented the feminine and fashionable vibe. I chose
the Vogue typeface for the headers and headlines because it is instantly identifiable, makes a strong
statement, and recalls thoughts of the fashion magazine &#39;Vogue&#39;.</p>

</p>
<p>
    Notes:
</p>
<p>
    - Scrolls a little bit, sounds confused
</p>
<p>
    - Menu does not move along with the page when scrolling down
</p>
<p>
    - Goes to best finds and sees dresses
</p>
<p>
    - Not clear what kind of site it is, not a clear home page
</p>
<p>
    - Individual assignment, top of the page
</p>
<p>
    - Annoying font use, Revise in small letters now but should be bigger
</p>
<p>
    - Not clear that the site is called Revise it looks like it’s called
    fashion news because those letters are bigger
</p>
<p>
    - Now goes to best finds page
</p>
<p>
    - She asks: what if I am not looking for a black dress and why am I looking
    at this
</p>
<p>
    - Do: ‘click here’ instead of ‘check it’, that’s clearer
</p>
<p>
    - Now she goes to the best trends page
</p>
<p>
    - Annoying that there are 5 images, I would use 6, that looks better
</p>
<p>
    - Links on the page to other websites are not responsive
</p>
<p>
    - It says best trends but it is one trend
</p>
<p>
    - Contact us page is clear
</p>
<p>
    - One page for fashion news, one page for best finds
</p>
<p>
    - Colors and overall look of the site is fine
</p>
<p>
    - Would not visit this website again, not clear what to do and what I see,
    boring and a little dull
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The website's message was unclear and did not pique Angela's attention,
    which is the main reason she would not visit it again. To solve this issue,
    I think I need to change some aspects of the website. The home page, she
    said, was the most bothersome. She had no idea what she needed to
    accomplish or what the website was about when she first opened it. I must
    therefore change the home page.
</p>
<p>
    The first version of the homepage looked like this:
</p>
<img src="../images/firsthome.png" class="img-fluid " alt="flow">
<p>
    As you can see, the font for the logo is much smaller than the font for
    fashion news This causes

    confusion since, in most cases, the logo is the first thing you notice when
    you visit a website. Because

    there is nothing on the homepage that piqued her attention or made it
    apparent what this website is

    about, the enormous images additionally confused her. She also noticed that
    the websites name was

    missing from the top of the page, above the URL. That needs to be altered.

    The new wireframe of the homepage looks like this:
</p>

<img src="../images/home.png" class="img-fluid " alt="flow">
<div>
    Changes to make the homepage clearer and more interesting:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    - Adding slogan and enlarging logo
</div>
<div>
    - Add images below with links to other pages like ‘best finds’ and ‘fashion
    news’.
</div>
<div>
    - Create separate page for ‘fashion news’.
</div>
<div>
    - Add favicon
</div>
<div>
    The next thing we need to change is rather small but very important not to
    forget: make the best find
    page links responsive.
</div>
<div>
    The other pages were clear and easy to use. The style and colors of the
    site were matching with the

    concept so these will remain the same.
